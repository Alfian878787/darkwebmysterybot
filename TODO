Dark Web Mystery Bot

TODO:

* Add a mode designed for safe-space instances.
  This would exclude the following three lists from output:
  * conspiracy (includes fringe stuff)
  * politics (it's divisive)
  * medieval (may offend some)
  * nationalities (doesn't exist yet - see below)
* Add "nationalities" list (note: safe space mode will be added first)
  Examples: dark web russian, marianas net filipino
* Add "specialist" list (the same as studies, but with "ists")
  Examples: dark net chemist, deep web accountant
* Add "deep web potion" support a la Stromedy and ImJayStation:
  Examples: deep web glyphosate potion, dark web crime potion, 3 AM gore potion
* Add support for generating fake dark web sites
  Examples: mace.onion, gender.loky, christian.clos, genie.dafy,
  paleontology.taur, creepypasta.end, astrology.nept
* Add the option to choose between "public" and "unlisted" mode when posting
  (currently it's forced public)
